# Jai 6502 Emulator
This is a very simple module that you can use to emulate 6502 CPU in Jai. Right now the module executes all the instructions as raw code, but I plan it to just use x64 assembly in the future to make it faster.

## Installation
Just put 6502_Emulation to your local modules folder.

## Note
The emulator is not done.
